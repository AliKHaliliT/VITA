# 0014. Pin the style's version at 0.0.1

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-08-10

## Context

A style is not a product. Nobody upgrades through releases of a template; a derived project copies the shape once and versions itself. Yet the family's version fields told product stories. This template's manifest carried 0.0.0, a placeholder that was merely inert rather than meaningful.

The owner ruled that everything in the family that never releases reads 0.0.1, one rule with no exceptions, so a version field can never again imply a release process that does not exist.

## Options considered

- **Cut releases properly.** Rejected: it would manufacture a release process purely to justify a number, and the changelog work that follows would document upgrades nobody performs.
- **Leave the numbers as decoration.** Rejected: a decoration that looks exactly like a promise is how this was found, since the pending question "what version comes next" only existed because 1.0.0 claimed there would be a next.
- **Pin 0.0.1 everywhere and delete what the pin obsoletes.** Accepted.

## Decision

The manifest version becomes 0.0.1, matching the family-wide meaning rather than npm's default placeholder.

## Consequences

The style never cuts a release, so upgrade-facing summaries have no home and impact lives in commit subjects, which the rulebook already provides for. A derived project starts its own versioning from whatever number it likes, and the attribution line in its README carries the provenance. The number 0.0.1 now means "this is a style" everywhere in the family.
