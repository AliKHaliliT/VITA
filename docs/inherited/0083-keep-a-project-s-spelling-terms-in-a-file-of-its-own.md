# 0083. Keep a project's spelling terms in a file of its own

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-09-24

## Context

The spelling advisory came with a promise. A flagged word is corrected or,
when it is a real term of the domain, named in the check's ignore list, so
the decision is written where the check runs, and the record that brought
the check said a project's own list grows in its own workflow. When the
advisory moved from the workflow into the docs audit, the list moved with it
into a constant of the script, a style-owned file a project carries byte for
byte and pins. From that day a project had no list it could write to. A real
term of its domain, an identifier the dictionary misreads or a word of
another language the product writes on purpose, printed on every run of
every change, and the only answer left was the same dismissal in every
commit message.

## Evidence

Three projects built from this style reported it at 66ba9f5, each naming an
icon component's identifier the dictionary reads as a misspelling, one of
them four words of other languages beside it. The audit's own advice line
still told the reader to name the term in the ignore list. Reading the
constant found two words, `afterall`, which is the client style's test hook
and nobody else's term, and `accreting`, a word of the audits' own
banned-vocabulary list and of no seat's prose, pardoned everywhere so the
audit would not report its own script. The audit now skips its own script
as quoting ground, as the family's root workflow skips the treasury.

## Options considered

- A project-owned copy of the audit script. Refused, because the script is
  style bytes held byte-identical, and a patched copy is the fork the
  upstream file exists to prevent.
- The dismissal repeated in every commit message. Refused, since the rule
  that names the commit message answers one run, and a term recurs on every
  run.
- A shared dictionary file in the template. Refused, because a term of one
  project's domain is noise in another's, which is why the family refused a
  family dictionary when the check arrived.

## Decision

A project's terms live in `.codespellignore` at the root, one word per line,
present only when a real term exists and never recopied at re-alignment,
like the state file. The docs audit passes it to codespell when it exists
and its advice line names it. The constant is gone. This seat ships the file with `afterall`, the test hook its suites call. The baseline's
trigger table carries the row, the rulebook's sentence names the file, and
the guide's list of advisories says the advisory reads it. The selftest
proves that a misspelling named in the file is not advised while an unnamed
one still is. Under the ladder the advisory keeps its rung.

## Consequences

A project names its term once and the advisory is silent about it from then
on, with the decision beside the check where the rulebook always said it
would be. A term that stops being used is removed with its trigger, as the
baseline's other conditional files are.
